# Criteria A - Inquiry and Analysis
## Design Brief
InfoCrypt is a web application that clients can utilize to monitor and analyze the Cryptocurrency market and provide insights and analytics on investment moves based on other users on  the platform. InfoCrypt will be secured using the users [Physical Identification Key](https://www.yubico.com/) to provide maximum security and privacy to the user. Demographics ranging from students that want to learn about cryptocurrency and blockchains to serious blockchain traders and scholars. The final goal of InfoCrypt is to create a well rounded platform that maximizes utility and aesthetics in order to provide the client the best experience on market analysis.  
This platform will leverage the power of the Yubikey API and CoinMarketCap API to fulfill it's functionality. These two providers are all leaders in the field that provide accurate and reliable data and authentication. 
## Need for Solution
InfoCrypt is designed for many demographics but mainly: students that are learning Crypto, Crypto token miners and blockchain node participants.  
The need for a swiftly accessible and accurate data representation of the market combined with insights and news is extremely important. There are between 51.2 to 51.4 million cryptocurrency traders worldwide, InfoCrypt opens up the doors for traders to have a centralized space for research and analytics. Currently there are mainly two kinds of application on the market, one that serves as a cryptocurrency wallet with minimal data and analytics such as Coinbase; and others focused on multiple indexes and data for different markets around the globe, such as Yahoo Finance. The downside of having the former, is that the user could not gather sufficient and accurate data for their analysis. The problem that arises with the later is that it's often not focused on cryptocurrency so that many key values and indexes are neglected and overlooked.  
In this kind of situation, InfoCrypt solves the problem by combining the focus of Cryptocurrency and the accurate data from reliable sources to help the end user/client get the most out of their investment journey.
