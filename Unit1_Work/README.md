# Criteria A - Inquiry and Analysis
## Design Brief
InfoCrypt is a web application that clients can utilize to monitor and analyze the Cryptocurrency market and provide insights and analytics on investment moves based on other users on  the platform. InfoCrypt will be secured using the users [Physical Identification Key](https://www.yubico.com/) to provide maximum security and privacy to the user. Demographics ranging from students that want to learn about cryptocurrency and blockchains to serious blockchain traders and scholars. The final goal of InfoCrypt is to create a well rounded platform that maximizes utility and aesthetics in order to provide the client the best experience on market analysis.  
This platform will leverage the power of the Yubikey API and CoinMarketCap API to fulfill it's functionality. These two providers are all leaders in the field that provide accurate and reliable data and authentication. 
## Need for Solution
InfoCrypt is designed for many demographics but mainly: students that are learning Crypto, Crypto token miners and blockchain node participants.  
The need for a swiftly accessible and accurate data representation of the market combined with insights and news is extremely important. There are between 51.2 to 51.4 million cryptocurrency traders worldwide, InfoCrypt opens up the doors for traders to have a centralized space for research and analytics. Currently there are mainly two kinds of application on the market, one that serves as a cryptocurrency wallet with minimal data and analytics such as Coinbase; and others focused on multiple indexes and data for different markets around the globe, such as Yahoo Finance. The downside of having the former, is that the user could not gather sufficient and accurate data for their analysis. The problem that arises with the later is that it's often not focused on cryptocurrency so that many key values and indexes are neglected and overlooked.  
In this kind of situation, InfoCrypt solves the problem by combining the focus of Cryptocurrency and the accurate data from reliable sources to help the end user/client get the most out of their investment journey.

## Product Examination
### CoinBase (Powered by CoinMarketCap API)
#### Graph Representation
The graphical representation of the market within the coin base app is not in detail. The user is only able to see a broad trend of the market with multiple windows of time to select. The pros of this page is that it's simple and straightforward for beginners, but for more advanced analytics and use, this graphical representation is not suffice.
#### Indices and Views
The coin base app will provide basic information on a crypto token. This includes the name, the current price and the change in price in the set timeframe as a percentage. The graphs also highlights some key points such as all time high within the window and the current price.
#### Stats and Units
The Coin base app gives a good insight on the basic statistics of the market. In a lot of tokes, this will be the market cap, the current volume, the all time high the start and end date of the token etc. These are important knowledge but it's not selected to target investors and analytics.

### Yahoo Finance
#### Detailed Graph
Yahoo finances provides a great graphical thumbnail for the user. This is due to the priority of the application. Yahoo finance focuses on serious investors and the graphical representation is targeted to users that has experience in cryptocurrency trading. As you can see, the application has big and clear titles and headings, below it has the current prices and the change in value in the selected timeframe. 
#### Detailed Analytics
If the user clicks and enters the detailed graph mode of yahoo finance, it will be much more helpful for the experienced investor. Yahoo finance focuses on different areas of trade, such as stocks and gold etc. This means that it's graphing process is very professional and detailed with variable time frame selection and options to change the look and highlight of the graph.  
Currently the graph is in candle mode, but the user could change it to line, bar, with color or not, and many other customizations to provide the most useful information for the user.
#### Key Statistics
The key statistics section of Yahoo finances is crucial. These are some important indices that investors and learners will look at to analyze the market. For example, the opening and closing price of the selected timeframe. But keep in mind, the cryptocurrency market is not like the stock market, there are many different indexes that differ from stock exchange. Yahoo finances is not specialized in the cryptocurrency market thus these key values are not the best to display here.

### Apple Stocks (Powered by Yahoo Finance)
#### Minimal Aesthetic
Apple stocks has a minimal and clean look. It's interface is similar to Yahoo Finances due to the data is gather via the Yahoo finances API. In this case, the overall feel and structure of the graphical representation maps to all the graphs that exists in the application. Although it does not provide as much detail and flexibility on timeframe and style, it definitely gets the job done. The user is able to click and hold on the graph to see the value of the select time.
#### Analytics and Selection
Apple stocks has a great analytics tool. The user is able to use two fingers to navigate a section of the graph and see the starting and ending nodes. The prices and change percentage is also displayed nicely.
On the bottom portion, there are some key statistics. These originate from Yahoo finances and they are fairly consistent with the original app.
#### Market News
The portion below the key statistics is the market news. Here Apple uses it's own news engine and provides news on the current company or in this case the crypto token from many of its partners. This is a great feature for investors to know the latest news of the market and help them make the crucial decisions.

## Additional Resources
### CoinBase Wallet System
Other than a cryptocurrency tool, Coin Base also integrates many cryptocurrency wallets. This allows users to use the platform as a way of investing and storing their property. 
### Yahoo Finance Limited Info
Both the Yahoo finance and the Apple stocks app has a section that has genera information about the token. This is not that useful since it's not fully populated and accurate. For users that would like to learn about cryptocurrency investment and how the system works, I plan on adding a section that targets this area.

## Chosen Design
### Modern Web Platform
I chose the modern Web App design due to it's novelty and the potential. Users are tire of the layout and the interaction with a traditional web page where there are well define components that perform different jobs. This design completely changes how users interact with data and how they will posse the ultimate control on the graph details. The settings will have a rich set of parameters that the user could store under their profile.
